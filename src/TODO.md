## Todo test

* Numbers. There should be no digits in the source text
* Abbreviations and Acronyms. Abbreviations and acronyms like “USA” or “ICE” should be avoided in the source text because they may be read in a way that does not coincide with their spelling.
* Punctuation. Special symbols and punctuation should only be included when absolutely necessary. For example, an apostrophe is included in English words like “don’t” and “we’re” and should be included in the source text, but it’s unlikely you’ll ever need a special symbol like “@” or “#.”
* No Foreign letters. Letters must be valid in the language being spoken.
* Length. Sentences must be 14 words or less.
